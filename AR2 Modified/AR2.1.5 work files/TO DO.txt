CREATING A BETTER MOVE

GOAL: TRAJECTORY TRACKING 

	read about vector value function again
	given a z value timestamps, reach those points using a function/trajectory tracking.
	
	start point is already on function that it wants to track.
	
	HOW TO MODIFY:
	callback funciton?
	input of the function what gets inputted in the script and what gets called to calc kinematics
	
	
IMPLEMENTATION?

	for linear updown, must give height brackets & period time: 
		once you start the program, depending on were its at, all other factors are fixed: x,y pos & yaw,pitch,roll fixed.
	
		calculation based on [upper-lower]cos(wt)+[lower]
	
	
	
	
NOTES:

	runProg() runs the program like you press the play button
	stopProg() stops the program like you press the stop button
	
	executeRow() runs the line in the loaded program
