How the AR2 Trajectory Tracks

	In main loop of program, before you can interact with the window again, the script calculates and saves all current angles and steps of each motor.
		this is broken down into three main functions
			
			SaveAndApplyCalibration() - finds and saves all DH parameters of the arm. also finds the current angle and step of each motor saving it to a global variable and saving all current position data into a calibration file.
			DisplaySteps() - displays steps calculated above
			CalcFwdKin() - calculates fwd kinematics to find x,y,z and rx, ry, rz data using method from excel sheet.


	
	To help visualize what is going on, imagine the arm is at the highest point of its configuration space and wants to move 600mm down while constraining all other motion.
		for ex:
			
			wrt the base frame
			
			1. x=1200mm y=0 z=0 rx=0 ry=0 rz=0
			2. x=600mm y=0 z=0 rx=0 ry=0 rz=0
			
			1. is the current position of the robot and 2. is the desired movement position of the arm

			the current position is the position that the arm is physically in and the desired movement is the position data saved in a move file that is to be executed
			
			
			Starting at the executerow() command - this command executes programs loaded from text files.
			
				1. reads the input file to receive the desired position data and speed, acceleration and deceleration values.
