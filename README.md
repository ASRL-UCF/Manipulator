# Manipulator-ASRL

This repo will host all working files being used for the manipulator currently in development in the Astrodynamics and Space Robotics Lab.

The lab currently uses the AR2 designed by Chris Annin (https://github.com/Chris-Annin/AR2) for the manipulator used in the Rapid Orbital Motion Emulator (ROME) research project.

Velocity Control through the MATLAB Support Package is used to increase the ability of the AR2. All files can be found in the Kinematics folder.

Aiding our research, a visualization tool for the AR2 was created, but is currently using broken inverse kinematics.

Original, unedited files for AR2 are hosted on this repo for orginization purposes.
All original code based on Chris Annin's AR2 robotic manipulator project: https://github.com/Chris-Annin/AR2

Original, unedited files for Robotics Toolbox by Peter Corke are hosted on this repo for orginization purposes.
